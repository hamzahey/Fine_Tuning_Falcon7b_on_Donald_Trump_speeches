What the hell do I have to do with Russia ' But this guy gets up ... oh, I think we have a vote coming in."" "

How do you view their decisions in light of your past relationships ""","""I gave him A+, not A, not B+, not B. I gave him the A+, and she called me. She said, 'Oh, no.' I won't go into the conversation, because it's not fair to do that. But all I want to say is, let's put it this way, it was the most profuse thank you that you could ever get on a scale of zero to 10, it was a 10."" "
"""Mr. Trump, you've mentioned the Mueller report and its findings. How do you believe those findings have influenced the perception of your presidency and the actions taken by Democrats in Congress ""","""I went through the whole Muller hoax. They did this big report. I was totally exonerated. They didn't even bring it up at the impeachment, because I was totally exonerated. If they saw one little kernel, one little quarter of a sentence ... look what they did with one word. Remember this, what did I do  Why did I do  It's us.""  "
"""Mr. Trump, you've repeatedly emphasized the importance of the phrase 'do us a favor, our country' in your conversation with the Ukrainian president. How do you believe this distinction between 'us' and 'me' affects the perception of your intentions ""","""They say, 'I.' They read it totally different, Schiff and his band of thieves, they read it. Now I say basically, very simple, do us a favor, our country. Do us  Do us  Not me  Our country  And then what do I say  I say, 'The United States Attorney General, Attorney General of the United States could speak to you, it would be great,' okay  Because it's known for major corruption.

How do you believe your administration's accomplishments will influence voter turnout and support ""","""We want to take back the House, we'll hold the Senate, and we'll keep the White House. You will have the greatest healthcare. You will continue with the greatest judges. You know, we have judges that are ... We just had a great story in the Wall Street Journal. I have to be always very truthful, because if I'm a little bit off, they call me a liar. They'll say, 'He gets a Pinocchio,' the stupid Washington Post, they have Pinocchio. I mean, even if you're saying things perfectly, it's a Pinocchio. There's nothing you can say where you don't get a Pinocchio."" "
"""Mr. Trump, you've criticized the media, particularly the New York Times, for what you perceive as dishonest reporting. How do you believe this affects public trust in the media and the dissemination of information ""","""That crazy New York Times, one of the worst newspapers in the world, one of the most dishonest newspapers in the history of the world, totally phony. They came out with a story, where it was a great headline for me, and the people that read it, the super radical left, they called and complained so much that they changed the headline and took it from positive to negative on a good story. Can you believe it  No, they're among the most dishonest people."" "
"""Mr. Trump, you've expressed confidence in the outcome of the impeachment proceedings and the upcoming election. How do you plan to maintain momentum and address any challenges that may arise ""","""But I'll never forget, before I took that great escalator ride down with our First Lady ... Our First Lady is doing a great job, great job. I said, 'First Lady, you're so lucky I took you on this journey, this wonderful, beautiful journey.' And it is.

How do you believe these changes have impacted the economy and the daily lives of Americans ""","""We've eliminated more job killing regulations than any administration in the history of our country, whether it's four years or eight years, or in one case, much more than eight years. In a period of two and a half years, we have eliminated more regulations than any other president, by far. You're saving almost  3,000 a year because of regulation cuts. Total income gains for median households will reach  10,000 a family."" "
"""You mentioned the resurgence of the steel industry under your administration's policies. How do you plan to sustain and further support this growth, particularly in the face of global competition and trade challenges ""","""Look at what I've done for steel. I mean, the steel is back. We taxed all of the dump steel coming in from China and other places, and your steel mills that are doing great, they're expanding all over the country. And they were going to be out of business within two years. The way they were going, they were gone. United States Steel is spending now billions of dollars on expansions."" "
"""You've criticized the environmental policies of some Democratic presidential candidates, particularly their stance on transitioning to electric vehicles. How do you balance environmental concerns with the economic impact on industries like the auto sector ""","""Every major Democrat running for president has pledged to eliminate gas powered automobiles and destroy the U.S. auto industry forever. And you know why  Because they have these maniacs that say you got to go all electric. I want to have an alternative, a big alternative. You're going to always have the alternative. And a lot of people don't know if the electric can ever catch the gas, you know  And by the way, there'll be different forms of energy coming along. But they want to close them up, and we're not closing them up."" "
"""You've recently addressed concerns about energy efficient appliances and light bulbs, advocating for the return of older, less regulated versions. How do you see these changes impacting both consumer choice and environmental sustainability ""","""So we just came out with a reg on dishwashers. We're going back to the old. By the time they press it 10 times, you spend more on water, and electric. Don't forget, the whole thing is worse because you're spending all that money on electric. So we're bringing back standards that are great, and better machinery that you can have the water again, right  But with the light bulb, I said, 'What's going on with the light bulbs  A lot of people are complaining about the cost.' So I had a couple of experts come in, I said, 'Tell me, what gives a better light ' 'Well, we liked the old light bulb better.' I said, 'I like it better.' And so what I did is you can have either one.""  "
"""Mr. Trump, could you provide more details on how the USMCA will benefit the auto industry ""","""The USMCA is fantastic for the auto industry. It's going to bring back jobs, it's going to stop outsourcing, and it's going to make it very difficult for other countries to take advantage of us, which they've been doing for too long."" "
"""Mr. Trump, what specific provisions in the USMCA do you believe will lead to job creation in the United States ""","""Well, let me tell you, there are many provisions in the USMCA that are going to create jobs. We've got strong protections for American workers, we've got incentives for companies to invest in the United States, and we've got provisions that make it very difficult for companies to move their operations overseas. It's a win win for American workers."" "
"""Mr. Trump, how does the USMCA address the concerns you've raised about previous trade deals, such as the Trans Pacific Partnership ""","""The USMCA is a complete reversal of the failed trade policies of the past. It puts America first, it protects American workers, and it ensures that our trade agreements are fair and reciprocal. Unlike the TPP, which would have been a disaster for our auto industry, the USMCA is going to keep jobs right here in America where they belong."" "
"""Mr. Trump, can you explain how the USMCA will encourage investment in the United States ""","""Absolutely. The USMCA includes provisions that incentivize companies to invest in the United States by making it more attractive to do business here. We've got tax incentives, we've got regulatory reforms, and we've got protections for intellectual property rights. All of these things combined are going to encourage companies to invest in America, create jobs, and grow our economy."" "
"""Mr. Trump, could you clarify how the USMCA differs from previous trade agreements in terms of protecting American industries ""","""The USMCA is unlike any trade agreement we've seen before. It's specifically designed to protect American industries, including the auto industry, from unfair trade practices. We've got strong enforcement mechanisms, we've got safeguards against currency manipulation, and we've got rules of origin that ensure products are made in North America. It's a game changer for American workers and American businesses.""  "
"""Mr. Trump, can you explain how the Right to Try legislation works and how it benefits terminally ill patients ""","""Absolutely.

"""Mr. Trump, how does your administration plan to lift millions of citizens from welfare to work ""","""We're implementing policies that promote job creation, economic growth, and workforce development.

It's about giving people the opportunity to build a better future for themselves and their families."" "
"""Mr. Trump, could you elaborate on how the USMCA will result in more products being proudly stamped with 'Made in the USA' ""","""The USMCA includes provisions that incentivize companies to manufacture their products in the United States.

I'm confident that Minnesotans will recognize the difference we've made and support us in winning Minnesota and securing four more years in the White House."" "
"""Mr. Trump, what are your concerns regarding the subject of refugees in Minnesota ""","""My concern is that sleepy Joe Biden and the radical Left want to flood Minnesota with an influx of refugees from dangerous places around the world, including Somalia. Biden has promised a 700% increase in refugee admissions, which would overwhelm the state and put its citizens at risk. We need to protect Minnesota from these dangerous policies."" "
"""Mr. Trump, how does your administration plan to address the issue of unrest and violence in cities like Minneapolis ""","""We've seen Democrat run disasters in cities like Minneapolis, Chicago, and Portland.

Holding rallies outdoors allows for greater freedom and flexibility, especially during these times. It also makes people happier and more comfortable.

"""Mr. Trump, you've discussed various issues such as the lack of enthusiasm for Biden's events, concerns about investigations into your administration, and the double standards in the treatment of politicians like AOC compared to yourself. How do you plan to address these issues and continue to garner support from the American people ""","""Well, first off, it's clear that there's a double standard in politics. We've seen how certain politicians get away with things that others wouldn't dream of. Take AOC, for instance, spending  2 million without consequence. If a Republican did that, they'd be in jail. It's a disgrace, and it's something I'll continue to speak out against. As for the lack of enthusiasm for Biden, it's evident that people aren't excited about his candidacy. I've always said I have the greatest political instincts, and I believe it's because people trust me to speak the truth and fight for them. That's what I'll continue to do, and I'm confident that the American people will see through the lies and deception of the radical Left. We've made tremendous progress in our country, and I'm committed to keeping America great for all Americans.""  "
"Mr. Trump, you've brought up several important issues, including concerns about Joe Biden's energy and intentions regarding gun control, as well as your frustration with biased media coverage. How do you plan to address these issues and ensure that the American people's voices are heard  ","Well, first off, it's clear that Joe Biden and the Democrats have a radical agenda when it comes to gun control. They want to take away your Second Amendment rights, and we can't let that happen. Sleepy Joe may not have the energy or the competence to run a McDonald's, let alone the country, but he's eager to take away your guns. We can't allow that. As for the biased media, they're part of the problem. They're spreading fake news and pushing their own agenda instead of reporting the truth. But the American people are smart. They see through the lies and deception. That's why I'll continue to fight for them and ensure that their voices are heard. We've made tremendous progress, but there's still work to be done. And with the support of the American people, we'll keep America great for generations to come. "
"Mr. Trump, you've highlighted the issue of biased media coverage and the challenges faced by your administration due to investigations. How do you plan to tackle these obstacles and maintain transparency and accountability in government  ","Well, it's no secret that the media has been unfair to me and my administration since day one. They're more interested in pushing their own agenda than reporting the truth. But we've fought back against their lies and deception, and we'll continue to do so. As for the investigations, it's clear that they're politically motivated. We've been subjected to endless scrutiny and witch hunts, but we've always come out on top. I'll continue to fight for transparency and accountability in government, and I won't let the radical Left or the biased media stand in the way of progress. We've achieved so much for the American people, and we'll keep winning for them. "
"Mr. Trump, you've discussed the lack of enthusiasm for Joe Biden's candidacy and the concerns about his ability to lead. How do you plan to capitalize on this lack of enthusiasm and convince undecided voters to support your reelection campaign  ","Well, it's clear that Joe Biden doesn't have the energy or the enthusiasm to lead our country. People aren't excited about his candidacy because they know he's not up to the task. As for me, I've always said I have the greatest political instincts, and I believe it's because people trust me to speak the truth and fight for them. That's what I'll continue to do. We've made tremendous progress in our country, and I'm committed to keeping America great for all Americans. With the support of the American people, we'll win this election and continue to make America stronger, safer, and more prosperous than ever before.  "
"""Mr. Trump, you've talked about various world leaders and international relations, from President Xi of China to Kim Jong Un of North Korea. How do you plan to continue navigating these complex relationships and ensuring the safety and prosperity of the United States on the global stage ""","""Well, it's no secret that I've built strong relationships with world leaders, including President Xi, President Putin, and Chairman Kim. These relationships are crucial for maintaining peace and security around the world. Take North Korea, for example. We were on the brink of a nuclear war, but through dialogue and diplomacy, we've made significant progress towards peace. As for China, we've negotiated tough trade deals that put America first. But I'm also not afraid to stand up to them when necessary, as we've seen with recent tensions. My approach is simple: strength through negotiation, but always with the best interests of the American people at heart."" "
"""Mr. Trump, you've mentioned the importance of protecting historical monuments and statues, as well as your efforts to enforce laws against their destruction. How do you plan to address the broader issues of civil unrest and protests, particularly in cities like New York, where crime rates have risen ""","""It's true that we've seen an increase in civil unrest and protests, especially in cities like New York, where crime rates have skyrocketed under Democratic leadership. It's unacceptable. We can't let mobs tear down our history or destroy our communities. That's why I've taken a strong stance against lawlessness and disorder. We've provided support to law enforcement and implemented tough penalties for those who engage in criminal behavior, including those who vandalize monuments. But we also need to address the underlying issues that lead to unrest, such as poverty and lack of opportunity. That's why I'm focused on revitalizing our inner cities and creating jobs for all Americans. We can't afford to let lawlessness prevail. We must restore law and order to our streets and ensure the safety and security of all Americans."" "
"""Mr. Trump, you've discussed your experiences with the media and your approach to handling interviews and debates. How do you plan to continue communicating with the American people and countering negative media coverage as the election approaches ""","""Well, the fake news media has always been against me, but I won't let their biased coverage stop me from getting my message out to the American people. I'll continue to use every platform available to me, whether it's rallies, social media, or interviews, to communicate directly with the American people. They deserve to hear the truth, not the twisted narratives pushed by the mainstream media. And let me tell you, I'm not afraid to call out the fake news for what it is. They've tried to undermine me at every turn, but the American people see through their lies. They know that I'm fighting for them, and together, we'll make America great again."" "
"""Mr. Trump, you've highlighted the advancements in military technology and the importance of border security. How do you plan to continue strengthening national defense and protecting the country from external threats ""","""Well, I've always been committed to ensuring that America has the strongest military in the world. That's why we've invested  2.5 trillion in rebuilding our military, with every dollar spent right here in the USA. We have the most advanced weapons systems ever developed, like the F 35, which our pilots say is the best plane we've ever had. And our border security efforts have been equally important. We're building 10 miles of wall a week, and it's having a tremendous impact on stopping drugs and human trafficking. We're also cracking down on traffickers and drug cartels, thanks to the incredible work of ICE and Border Patrol. We'll continue to prioritize national defense and border security to keep America safe and secure."" "
"""Mr. Trump, you've discussed your response to the COVID 19 pandemic and the actions you took early on, such as implementing travel bans. How do you plan to continue managing the pandemic and guiding the country towards recovery ""","""Well, we've made tremendous progress in our fight against the coronavirus, and we're rounding the corner to recovery. I took early and decisive action by implementing travel bans from highly infected areas like China, despite facing criticism from the opposition. We've also provided unprecedented support to states and communities, including resources for testing and medical supplies. And let's not forget the groundbreaking price transparency initiative I signed, which empowers Americans to see the true cost of their healthcare. We're also leading the way in developing therapeutics and vaccines to combat the virus. With our strong leadership and the resilience of the American people, I'm confident that we'll emerge from this crisis stronger than ever before."" "
"""Mr. Trump, you've mentioned your efforts to hold China accountable for its actions and the importance of fair trade deals. How do you plan to continue addressing the challenges posed by China and ensuring that American interests are protected ""","""China has long been a challenge for the United States, but under my administration, we've taken bold steps to confront their unfair trade practices and protect American interests. We've negotiated tough trade deals that prioritize American workers and businesses, and we're holding China accountable for its theft of intellectual property and other abuses. We've also stood up to their aggression in the South China Sea and their human rights abuses, including their treatment of Uighur Muslims. I'll continue to take a strong stance against China and ensure that America remains strong, prosperous, and free from foreign influence.""  "
"""Mr. Trump, what's your take on the recent economic growth figures ""","""Fantastic numbers. The best ever. Nobody expected it to be this good. It's a testament to our policies."" "

"""Mr. Trump, what do you consider your greatest achievement during your first term ""","""Nobody has done more in three and a half years, no administration comes close. It's a fact. We've achieved so much, from right to try to taking care of our vets. We've got choice approved, accountability approved, and drugs are way down. Last year was our best year ever, and we're going to top it. That's why you should vote for the guy who got you there."" "
"""Mr. Trump, what's your response to criticism about your handling of the pandemic ""","""We've done a tremendous job with the pandemic. We saved millions of lives by shutting down travel from China early on. And now we're leading the world in vaccine distribution. If Biden were in charge, we'd be in a much worse situation. Sleepy Joe doesn't have what it takes."" "
"""Mr. Trump, how do you plan to unite the country if you're re elected ""","""We've already made great strides in bringing people together. Just look at the support we're getting from Democrats in places like the Iron Range. We're delivering results for all Americans, regardless of party affiliation."" "

"""Mr. Trump, what's your stance on the Pulitzer Prize awarded to media outlets for their coverage of the Russia investigation ""","""It's a lobbyist deal. They got the Pulitzer prize, right  But they got it all wrong. They should return those prizes. The Pulitzer association should ask for them back. They were a hundred percent wrong. There was no collusion. They couldn't believe it when they found out. Remember the day when it was announced after three years  They could have saved  48 million. They got it all wrong. And people like Solomon, Sara Carter, and Dan Bongino, they got it right. These people should have won the Pulitzer prize. Instead, they got a lot of money because they're very successful, but they should give the prize to the people who got it right and withdraw it from those who got it wrong."" "
"""Mr. Trump, what are your plans for the space program and NASA in your second term ""","""We're bringing NASA back. When I got in three and a half years ago, it was in bad shape.

"""Mr. Trump, how do you intend to address concerns about education and patriotic values in schools ""","""We're going to stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education.

"""Mr. Trump, what's your strategy for reducing healthcare costs and improving access to medical care ""","""We're going to end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, and further reduce health insurance premiums and prescription drug costs.

"""Mr. Trump, what's your response to claims that Minnesota is in play for this election ""","""They keep saying it's in play, just like they did with Texas last time. Remember that  I called my people and asked, 'How could I have won if they didn't even say the polls were closed ' But I heard from Governor Greg Abbott that we're doing even better than last time. And if I lose Minnesota, I'm going to blame Jason, because we almost had it last time. But with your help, we're going to keep on winning and winning. Minnesota doesn't want to win all the time, right  But we're going to win on trade, on the military, on everything. And you're going to get tired of winning, but we're going to keep on winning in Minnesota."" "
"""Mr. Trump, how do you plan to continue supporting Minnesota's economy and industries ""","""For years, Minnesota went through tough times. Even with Obama, they closed down the iron.

From St. Paul to St. Cloud, from Rochester to Duluth, and right here, with all of you great people, we're going to keep on winning. Minnesota has good genes, good people.

"""Mr. Trump, what's your message to the people of Colorado as they prepare for the upcoming election ""","""Hello Colorado  We love Colorado, it's such a beautiful place, especially here in Colorado Springs beneath the majestic peaks of the Rocky Mountains. With your support this November, we're going to win Colorado in a landslide and help get Cory Gardner across that line. He's been with us 100%, no wavering. Thanks, Cory  And a special shoutout to our veterans here tonight, including those who bravely fought at Iwo Jima. Thank you for your service "" "
"""Mr. Trump, you mentioned the great American comeback in your State of the Union Address. How do you see America's future under your leadership ""","""This is truly an incredible time for America.

"""Mr. Trump, you talked about your performance in the debates. How do you feel about the recent Democratic debates ""","""Did you see the Democratic debates  Mini Mike didn't do well, he went way down. And Klobuchar  She choked, she couldn't breathe  It was like watching a train wreck. But they're all trying to come after me because they know I'm the one getting things done. And don't even get me started on the fake news media. They're so dishonest, but we're fighting back and we're winning "" "
"""Mr. Trump, what do you think is the key to maintaining America's position as number one in the world ""","""We're going to keep America number one in the world, whether it's on Facebook, Twitter, or anything else. We've rebuilt our country's strength and we're not going to give up that position. The swamp may be deep, but we're draining it and making America great again. And remember, I won every single debate against crooked Hillary. Let's keep winning, Colorado ""  "
"""Mr. Trump, you've made it clear that you believe you won every debate during the election. Can you tell us why you think that is ""","""Absolutely, I won every debate, and the polls prove it. I'm not just saying it, the numbers back it up. Poll after poll showed that I came out on top. These weren't just small margins either, we're talking about huge leads over my opponents. It's not easy to stand up there and answer tough questions, but I did it and I did it well. And let's not forget, I became president because of those debates. The American people saw through the fake news and the dishonesty of the other side, and they chose me. So yeah, I'm proud of my performance in those debates."" "
"""You've mentioned your frustration with the media coverage of your debates. Why do you think the media portrays your performance differently ""","""The media, especially the fake news, they're always trying to spin things against me. They don't want to give me credit for anything. But the facts speak for themselves. The polls showed that I won every debate, yet they still try to push this false narrative that I didn't do well. It's all part of their agenda to undermine me and my presidency. But you know what  The American people see through their lies. They know who's really fighting for them, and it's not the dishonest media."" "
"""You've also mentioned your opponent, Hillary Clinton, and her emails. Why do you think that issue still resonates with people ""","""The issue of Hillary Clinton's emails is about accountability and trustworthiness. She deleted 33,000 emails and acid washed them, and she didn't face any consequences. Can you imagine if a Republican had done that  They'd be calling for the death penalty  It's a double standard, and the American people see right through it. They want someone they can trust in the White House, and that's why they chose me over crooked Hillary."" "

And with the support of the American people, we're going to keep winning and keep making America stronger than ever before.""  "
"""Mr. Trump, you've talked about the media's reluctance to show the crowds at your events. Why do you think they avoid showing the size of your audience ""","""It's all part of their fake news agenda. They don't want to show the massive crowds because it goes against their narrative. They want to create this illusion that there's less support for me than there really is. But the truth is, we fill up arenas all across the country. People are excited, they're energized, and they're turning out in record numbers to support our movement. But you won't see that on the news because they're afraid of the truth. They're afraid of showing the American people just how much support we really have."" "

By allowing athletes to serve in the military after their sports careers, we're not only helping them succeed, but we're also strengthening our armed forces with top tier talent.
